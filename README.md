# hello-world
My first repository. I have high expectations so you better not fail me. 
I am editing you to make my first commit. Is it wierd that I am typing in the 2nd person?

Ok, me-from-the-one-year-ago-past, you are right, it is weird. Is that really typing in the 2nd person? First, how does one type in any specific person anyways? Your fingers type, but they cannot do it in any particular person. So, I'll assume you meant writing in the 2nd person. Second, you are speaking to the computer, not yourself, and using the personal pronoun "I" with your sentences, just as I am, so I would say that is 1st person speech, not 2nd. Again, you are right. It is weird. At least it doesn't look as though your repository failed you.
